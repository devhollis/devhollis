👋 Hi, I’m @devhollis, and I am very new to using Git and Github.

👀 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer and making it a full time job.

🌱 I’m currently learning python, and I am dabbling around in various subjects. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning projects and anything that I can assist with to build experience.

📫 You can reach me at dhollisalt@gmail.com.

I have been interested in programming since I was 13 years old and now I am working hard to make myself a dedicated developer.
